News categorization:

	1- Can the news be cataloged using the description and the headlines? Compare your classification with the categories included in the dataset.
    2 - Are there writing styles associated with each category?
    3 - What can be said about the authors?
    4 - What useful information can be extracted from the data?


Using jupyter notebook, it's possible to access the following files:
'News Multi_Class - Preprocessing and EDA.ipynb'
'News Classification - Supervised learning.ipynb'
'NMF-News Classification - unsupervised learning.ipynb'
'Latent Dirichlet Allocation - News Classification - unsupervised learning'

Each notebook is commented and also there is PDF file "Data Analysis.pdf" that contains an presentation.

In the case of this analysis reproduction, you can just run those files following the same order of reading above described.

Enjoy.
